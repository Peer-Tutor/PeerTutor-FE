# Development Guide

Components should be developed such that they are as modular as possible.

Please split the code into logical components as much as possible!

### App styling:
- CSS Modules (CSS StyleSheets But Scoped Locally)

Guidelines: All stylings should be scoped locally to avoid interference with other components, unless you are defining stylings that is meant to be shared across the App. For example: Font-family
